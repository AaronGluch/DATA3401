 - Sophomore, I think
 - Major: Data Science; Minor: Mathematics
 - The course material that seems most relevant to me is just getting used to Python syntax and getting used to Github, neither of which I've really done much with before despite being familiar with R and good at statistical analysis.
 - I've written in R, C, Java, PHP, and Lisp
 - I spend most of my time researching topics that interest me.
